# A Playground for messing around with vanilla JavaScript

First, try forking this repo and making your own branch. Then try something! Make a change to the readme, or one of the base files. Commit, push, and open a pull request. Once we figure out how to make changes here we can start creating issues around fun games to try to build. We can start slow... like maybe with a number guessing game or something.

To deploy changes at a common url:
- intsall surge (`npm install --global surge`)
- run `surge` to deploy
